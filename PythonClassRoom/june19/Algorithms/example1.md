## Add Two numbers

1. allocate memory for number1 and call it as __a__
2. allocate memory for number2 and call it as __b__
3. add __a__ and __b__ and assign this new memory location __c__
4. print __c__


From above steps of your alogorithim
* allocate memory and assign to __a__  
    * allocate memory but how much
    * programming language => data types
        * int a = 10; (c, C++, Java, C# )
        * a = 10  (python, ruby)
* add/substract/divide  are called as operators


### Refined Algorithim
1. a := x 
2. b := y
3. print a+b

### Python
```
a = 10
b = 20
c = a+b
print(c)
```

### Java
```
int a = 10;
int b= 20;
c = a+b;

```
